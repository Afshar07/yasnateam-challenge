## Project Log
This was a hire challenge for Yasna team, I've used animations along side vue js, a little error handling (not much styling tho) and etc.
It's a pretty simple project, not much to describe.

## Note to myself
I must learn some UI Design if i want to be able to make a delightful UI on my own!
